Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Why have you put the specification in a package and not 
your implementation? Please be consistent.

Testing should have been more extensive.

Add javadoc even for private fields.

Perhaps add a throws clause when throwing an exception even if it 
isn't strictly required (good documentation).

Going forward consider Java 8 constructs.

Not quite sure why you needed the DataStore?
Do you mean to expose that to the client?

Good attempt - Merit.
